st.markdown("""
### 🎯 Purpose of the Experiments  

These experiments are designed to examine how AI voices affect viewer engagement in online video platforms.  
While prior analyses showed correlations between AI voice usage and engagement outcomes, those findings may be influenced by changes in other video characteristics.  

To establish causal evidence, we conducted two randomized online experiments 🔬:  
- **Study 1 on AI Process Augmentation** ⚙️: Investigates whether AI voices change engagement depending on the creator’s language proficiency.  
- **Study 2 on AI Content Substitution** 🔄: Examines whether alignment between the creator’s identity and the AI-generated voice influences engagement.  

✅ Both studies were reviewed and approved by the institutional ethical review board.
